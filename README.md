# Browsersync Example for WSL2

The browsersync example on [https://browsersync.io/](https://browsersync.io/) works with ease on linux, but when I tried using browsersync on WSL2 it just wouldn't work or partially work. There was alot of extra effort to get browsersync working in WSL2, and this example shows how I got it working.

Some information about my system:

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Mr Smith> wsl -l -v
  NAME                   STATE           VERSION
* Ubuntu-20.04           Running         2
```

Follow these steps, and hopefully browsersync will work for your WSL2 environment.

## Step #1 - Use your linux home path.

You must use your /home/[username] path.

```bash
mrsmith@miyasato:browser-sync-example$ pwd
/home/mrsmith/browser-sync-example
```

Do not use paths off of /mnt

```bash
mrsmith@miyasato:browser-sync-example$ pwd
/mnt/c/Users/Mr Smith/Desktop/browser-sync-example
```

## Step #2 - Configure your default browser with wslview

You will need to configure your default browser via [wslview](https://wslutiliti.es/wslu/man/wslview.html). wslview is part of [wslu](https://wslutiliti.es/wslu/) which may already be bundled with your distro choice in WSL2.

Just check with the **which** command:

```bash
mrsmith@miyasato:browser-sync-example$ which wslview
/usr/bin/wslview
```

Yup, its installed.

If you don't have wslview, you will need to install wslu from here:
https://wslutiliti.es/wslu/install.html

## Step #3 - Run the wslview commands:

### For Google Chrome:

```bash
wslview -r $(wslpath -au 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe')
```

### For Microsoft Edge:

```bash
wslview -r $(wslpath -au 'C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe\MicrosoftEdge.exe')
```
